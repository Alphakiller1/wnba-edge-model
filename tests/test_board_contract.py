"""
The shared board contract.

`board.py`, `board.css` and `chase_tokens.css` are vendored BYTE-IDENTICAL into mlb-model,
wnba-edge-model and nfl-model. That is the whole mechanism keeping the three products on
one brand: same card anatomy, same palette, same typefaces.

If this test fails you changed a shared file in one repo only. The fix is to copy it into
all three and regenerate `BOARD_CONTRACT.sha256` in each — not to edit the hash here.

Hashes are taken over newline-normalised bytes: Windows checkouts carry CRLF while CI
runs on LF, and a contract that fails on the checkout's line endings tests the platform
rather than the content.

This file is itself vendored; keep the copies identical apart from `_VENDORED`.
